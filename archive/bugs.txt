resolved 20200916: punctuation left off at ends of some sentences
  added second parameter to indexOf to specify where search should start. otherwise, was starting from beginning each time,
  so repeated words were always matching first instance in key
resolved 20200916: .com not working all the times
  changed to global replace. escaped . (otherwise was replacing com in combat, for instance)
resolved 20200916: tab
  added shift-tab event listener to allow indenting
resolved 20200918: change focus after button press to be in text area


resolved? 20200918: shift alone is triggering shift-tab after tab.
  added conditions for just tab, just shift. seems to be working so far.
